# JavaWithDatabaseProject

This was a school project.  Warning to other students: Don't do anything to violate your schools academic integrity policies.  Plus this code is super inefficient
and buggy.  It technically worked for my project but if I was to do it over, I would probably change my solution for most aspects of this project.
